## üåêAbout CodeTime

- CodeTime is a plugin for Sublime Text editor which will help developers to track the amount of time spent on multiple files, programming languages and projects. The user will be able to perform the analysis of the time spent to improve the productivity by analysing the most frequently used programming language, most productive time of the day, files in project which took maximum time for development and projects which took maximum time for completion.

- The developer can add the project deadlines to the plugin and the plugin can help developers stick to their goal by predicting the finish time of the project based on the data gathered from the user. Multiple developers can compete with each other through a leaderboard where a leaderboard will display the ranking of most productive developer and admin/manager can easily monitor the productivity of each and every developer with the help of a common interface.

## üíªInstallation

1. Open Sublime Text.
2. Go to Preferences -> Browse packages.
3. A new window containing Sublime packages directory will open up. Let's call this folder `SublimePackagesFolder`.
4. Open your terminal and navigate to `SublimePackagesFolder`.
5. Clone this repository inside `SublimePackagesFolder` (This makes sure that Sublime recognizes our plugin package to execute).
6. Copy the [Context.sublime-menu](code/SublimePlugin/Config/Context.sublime-menu) file to your User Packages directory. To go to User Packages directory, navigate to `SublimePackagesFolder/User` folder.
7. You are all set. The plugin is now active and is running in the background.
8. Once you open a file for the first time in sublime a user id will be generated in the folder "<User>/APPDATA/Roaming/codeTime/userid.txt".
9. Use this user id to login to "http://152.46.17.237:8080" and see the statistics from the plugin.

## Experimentation goal:
To compare between this implementation of code time, second team's implementation of code time and the results that can be obtained by observing manually. 

## üîëExperimentation Setup steps:
1. Create a buggy implementation in three languages as we did for HW3 or you can use reuse the same codes.
2. Setup code for a statistical test like "Scott Knot with nonparametric effect size and significance test" as we saw in class to compare different languages. Refer to this code: [sk.py](https://gist.github.com/timm/41b3a8790c1adce26d63c5874fbea393) by professor menzies.

## üí≠Conducting experiment with lab rats:
1. Each participant will download sublime code editor.
2. Each participant will try to debug the codes and time will be recorded for each language by a team member.
3. Using the implementation of two teams' code time generated statistics try to rank languages in terms of difficulty for each implementation.
4. Compare the ranks from the two implementations with the statistical analysis that we did using Scott Knot with nonparametric effect size and significance test and conclude which implementation provided better analysis.


## üî®Setup (For contributors)

> <strong>Note:</strong> Please install and use Sublime Text 3 only for development.

1. Perform the steps in the [Installation](https://github.com/oaaky/SE_Fall20_Project-1#installation-for-non-contributors) section described above.
2. Install Package Control by pressing `ctrl+shift+p (Win/Linux)` or `cmd+shift+p (Mac)`.
3. Run `python setup.py install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Back in Sublime Text, Open Package Control by pressing `ctrl+shift+p (Win/Linux)` or `cmd+shift+p (Mac)`. Navigate to option `Package Control: Install Package`. Install  packages: `SublimeLinter`, `SublimeLinter-flake8`, `sublack`, `UnitTesting`.
5. Navigate to `Package Settings` option under `Preferences` in Menu bar. For `Mac` users, the `Preferences` option will be found under `Sublime Text` in Menu bar.
6. Run the flask app locally by using the command 'python3 flask_server.py' inside the Flask_App folder and also appropriately change the request address in codeTime.py and periodicLogSaver.py. You can also run the server on any other machine similarly.
